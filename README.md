# A NES Emulator written in Rust

I'm basing this project on this [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8kx56OZQhg) by `javidx9`. I've done some things a little differently, but I'm not trying to be too different, since I don't really know what I'm doing yet.

- No, this is not excellent code.
- Yes, it is my first *real* Rust project
- Yes, it's a REALLY ambitious project
- Yes, I hope that one day this is _actually_ working and is really cool
